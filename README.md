# 2021-COMP3016-W2: Free Project

Please update this file and include the instructions and use this document for your report.

Make sure to work entirely using OpenGL4.X which you can check if your project relies on shader files and does not use fixed functions for rendering.

Ideally keep the setup Rendering toolchain to reduce the trial and error process of finding something new that works for you.

Work incrementally and be aware of the scale and scope of your project.
